=============================

nodejs scraper for capital bikeshare (probably others too) profiles

I wanted to get my data off of [Capital Bikeshare](www.capitalbikeshare.com) but wanted to stick to Node.JS instead of python or ruby (which are out there)... so I wrote my own.

Using ZombieJS I'm able to login, scrape profiles for various data and check for updates.

==TODO==

* ~~Member Profile~~
* ~~Total Number of Rentals~~
* Get All of Rental History
* Get # Most Recent Rentals
* Rental Statistics (Last 200 Trips)
* Rental Statistics (Lifetime)
